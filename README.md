## Overview
An online skill exchange platform called MarsPortal where you can share your skills with another person in exchange for money or learn new skills. Users can list their skills on the site and while guest users can search for the skills they are looking for, skill seekers can buy the skills or negotiate to learn the skills by exchanging their own skills. If a deal is made, the users can use the platform to manage their expectations and the outcome.
